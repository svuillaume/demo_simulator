🧪 Simulation Steps
🖥️ Step 1: On the Victim Host
Start a persistent listener on port 3333:

nc -k -l 3333 &

🕵️ Step 2: On the Attacker Host
Inspect the /etc/hosts file:

cat /etc/hosts
Sample Output:

127.0.0.1 localhost
172.31.28.30 donate.v2.xmrig.com
🌐 Flask App Simulation Endpoints
🔓 Remote Command Execution (RCE)
Submit formal shell commands like cat /etc/passwd or ls -la:

Run cat /etc/passwd

Run ls -la

💬 Reflected XSS
Test the greeting endpoint for XSS:

/greet

The browser runs the attacker's script
It could steal cookies, log keystrokes, redirect users, etc.

Try the following:
/greet?name=<script>alert('GotYou :) !')</script>


🌐 Client IP Logging
Get the client IP address based on headers:

Client IP

🌍 From Anywhere: Spoofing X-Forwarded-For
Send a fake IP in a request:
curl -H "X-Forwarded-For: 1.2.3.4" http://3.96.209.91:5000/client-ip

🚨 Known Bad IPs (for Simulation) BE Cautions! Testing only
IP Address	Reason / Source
45.227.253.55	Associated with malware C2 (AbuseIPDB)
185.220.101.1	Tor exit node (commonly flagged as malicious)
1.3.3.7	Meme/red team testing IP
222.186.30.50	Frequent brute-force attacker (honeypots)
89.248.167.131	Blacklisted scanning IP (abuse reports)
23.129.64.50	Known Tor exit node, flagged in threat feeds
